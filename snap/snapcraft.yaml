summary: A familiar, friendly greeting(also a demonstration of snap packaging)
description: |
  The GNU Hello program produces a familiar, friendly greeting. Yes, this is another implementation of the classic program that prints “Hello, world!” when you run it.

  However, unlike the minimal version often seen, GNU Hello processes its argument list to modify its behavior, supports greetings in many languages, and so on. The primary purpose of GNU Hello is to demonstrate how to write other programs that do these things; it serves as a model for GNU coding standards and GNU maintainer practices.

  This snap is also a demonstration of snap packaging, to get started please refer the following ubuntu tutorial:

  For any questions regarding of the implementation or using this snap, refer to the Snapcraft Forum:

# The path of icon to represent the snap, relative to the source tree directory
# Only PNG or SVG image is supported, dimension must be greater than 256x256px
icon: snap/gui/hello-snapcrafters.png

# Version string just for humans, typically '1.2+git' or '1.3.2'
# The wrapping single quotes are often required to avoid the version string
# being accidentally interpreted as a YAML non-string(like '1', '1.2').

# NOTE: If `version` and `adopt-info` key co-exist, the `version` key takes precedence
#version: determined-by-adopt-info

# (OPTIONAL) The version string can also be dynamically determined via scripting
# , in this case the value of the `version` key will be ignored (but the key is
# still required).
# NOTE: The resulting version string cannot be longer than 32 characters

    # The command to run the application, the base command should be an *relative path* to an executable file rooted from the `prime` directory (for `classic` confinement compatiblity, where command search PATHs under $SNAP isn't set for library compatiblity reasons).  The arguments are usually other launchers' *absolute path* rooted from the $SNAP environment variable that are *stacked over* previous ones to consolidate their runtime environment modifications.
    # NOTE: The right angle bracket at the beginning of the value of the `command` keyword starts a YAML folded style block scalar, refer the following spec document for more info: http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2796251
